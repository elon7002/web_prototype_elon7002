                  Loved it.<br><br>
                  Formed part of our day in Vis and we are pleased we took up the offer of visiting. The trip kicked off with a ‘fast’ speed boat trip over to the island of Biševo. On arrival there, we were moved to a much smaller boat to enable access in the cave. It was a short journey there but on entry to the cave, the WOW factor kicked in given the eerily blue light within and hence the name. However, if you can afford it, do it!

                  Blue cave. Beautiful. A must-see place.<br><br>
                  Having read that the Blue cave had to be seen if on Vis, we went as part of an island tour by speed boat. Left Vis town at 8 am to beat the crowds. You can only get by boat, you need to buy tickets, transfer to a small boat to get into the cave. Check the weather is good and low tide. Be prepared to wait in line unless you get the speedy access. A must-see place.

                  Cool experience<br><br>
                  Checking out this cave is a short but cool 5-minute experience. You'll wait in line a bit shorter if you go early in the morning. You go in, the guide tells you the cave's history, you enjoy the beautiful blue light reflections, and you go out. It isn't much but it's definitely unique and worth it.

This unique sea cave is renowned for its stunning azure-blue waters, which are illuminated by sunlight filtering through an underwater entrance. The resulting play of light creates an otherworldly, ethereal ambiance within the cave's interior.<br><br> The Blue Cave is at its most breathtaking during the morning hours when the sunlight hits the water at the perfect angle, creating an almost surreal, iridescent blue glow. Visitors can access the cave by a small boat, and once inside, they are treated to a serene and magical experience, making the Blue Cave a must-see destination for anyone exploring the Dalmatian coast.

            The Monk Seal Cave, also known as Medvidina Cave, on the island of Biševo in Croatia, is a place of natural wonder and historical significance. This coastal cave, like the Blue Cave on the same island, boasts crystal-clear waters that shimmer in shades of blue and green. However, what makes the Monk Seal Cave particularly intriguing is its connection to the Mediterranean monk seal, one of the world's most endangered marine mammals. Historically, these elusive creatures sought refuge and raised their pups in the cave's hidden corners.

              <p style="width: 90%; text-align: left;">
                  In the year 1050, a clergyman named Ivan, hailing from Split, oversaw the construction of a church on the plateau of Biševo, dedicated to Pope St. Sylvester (314 – 335). This historical figure was renowned for securing the right of Christians to openly profess their faith. Father Ivan entrusted the church to the Benedictines, who arrived from the Tremiti Islands. Initially built in the pre-Romanesque style, the church underwent architectural alterations in the subsequent centuries. During a turbulent era marked by battles between Venice and the Byzantine Empire for control over the region, the Monastery of St. Silvester on Biševo sought protection from Pope Alexander III. On May 2, 1181, the Pope issued a privilege that granted safeguard to this monastery. The document began with the Pope's address to the monastery's superior, Abbot Urso, and it was intended to extend protection to both the present and future monastic brethren.
